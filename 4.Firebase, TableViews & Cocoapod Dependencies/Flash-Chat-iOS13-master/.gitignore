I think .dll files are important if you're developing with .NET.

Also, you could include .ai, .eps, and .psd on it.

Thanks, for the great snippet.

@arulrajnet @cptstarling it is not recommended to ignore entire .idea directory. Instead we should add only the two lines below to local .gitignore file:

/.idea/workspace.xml
/.idea/tasks.xml
This way all good project configuration (for example Code Style, namespaces mapping, etc) will be shared among all team.

*.log isn't working for me. I have the logs 'server.log', 'connected.log', and 'visitorcount.log' in a folder named 'logs', and GitHub Desktop keeps asking me to commit the files whenever they are modified.

I'm using Notepad to add these updates and have rebooted GitHub Desktop. Is there any weird technical feature that I am missing?

@giovannipds

And *.sublime-workspace for those who use SublimeText. It's important not adding these files, for security reasons.

@giovannipds

And I agree with @ScottyMJacobson, *.sql files are important for some projects, I'm used to adding the initial version of the database this way. Suits me well... any advices?

@umeboshi2
umeboshi2 commented on Dec 30, 2017
Global git ignores seem to be quite improper when a person is using git-annex. I first experienced this a couple of years ago: umeboshi2/dotfiles@49292a1

Today, while trying to update the git-annex repo for http://ifarchive.org I found a few more. Please add some language that qualifiy the suggestions from github to allow for the addition of certain "ignores" that may need to be tracked above git, yet still be under the constraints of the ignore file.

In all honesty, the suggestions from this gist, with respect to the config being global, and also the use of git-annex, has eliminated many of your suggestions. Even my opinion on *~ wasn't met by http://ifarchive.org. My ignore file is here: https://github.com/umeboshi2/dotfiles/blob/master/gitignore_global

Please understand that I was actually surprised by a "filename~" existing on the mirror and had to really .think about the ignore file. That was not your suggestion, but I was surprised anyway.

My purpose for the comment is to encourage github to provide some sort of "disclaimer" that these files may not need to be ignored.

It's very possible that git-annex may want to "ignore" the global ignores and have it's own global ignore file and not respect the global git ignore config. I will try to bring that point across to Mr. Hess if able.

@lucanos
lucanos commented on Feb 24, 2018
Also remember to add

*.
Mac OS seems to have no problems with filenames ending with a period, but Windows does, and GIT on Windows will not interact with a Repo which has any files with this hanging period.

+1 on removing .sql from this list, Rails can save the schema files as structure.sql which should be checked into version control.
